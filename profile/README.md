## Community Guildelines

Here are a list of Guidelines for use:
- Any Repository that has not received any updates in one year will marked as Archived and put into a read-only state.
  - Any Repository that is Archived will get an email sent out to users who have contributed to the repository as notice.
  - Each Repository may also contain a `stakeholders.txt` file in the root that contains email addresses of anyone who relies on the contents of the repository but has not contributed.  This list will also get an email notice.
- Any Repository that has been in an Archived state and not attested to for 1 year will be Deleted.
  - Prior to deletion, an email notification will go out to contributors and stakeholders one week before deletion.
